        <p class="subtitle">Mastering the Second Shot</p>
        
        <div class="highlight-box">
            One of the most important things a tennis player can learn is the critical importance of the second shot. Understanding and mastering this concept is just as vital as developing a good serve and return of serve.
        </div>

        <p>While most players obsess over perfecting their serve and return, tennis strategy experts have discovered something remarkable: <span class="stat-highlight">70-80% of all points end within the first five shots</span>, and the second shot often determines who controls the point.</p>

        <div class="expert-quote">
            <strong>Tennis Strategy Expert Craig O'Shannessy reveals:</strong> "It's not good enough only to have a plan for your serve. You need to be thinking about your Serve +1 shot as well... At the 2023 Australian Open, 70% of all serves in the men's draw came back into play. Almost two out of three first serves come back into a rally."
        </div>

        <p>The second shot isn't just about technique‚Äîit's about <strong>seizing control of the point</strong> at the earliest possible moment. Whether you're the server hitting your follow-up shot (Serve +1) or the returner preparing for your next ball (Return +1), this shot can decide matches!</p>
        
        <h2 class="article-subtitle">The Second Shot Strategy by Skill Level</h2>

        <div class="level-section">
            <div class="level-title">üìö Levels 4.0 and Below: Foundation First</div>
            <p><strong>Primary Goal: Get every second shot in play.</strong></p>
            <p>At developing levels, consistency trumps aggression. Your mission is simple but crucial:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>When serving:</strong> Even if you struggle with double faults on your serve, the moment you get that first or second serve in, prioritize getting your second ball safely in play. A conservative but smart second shot keeps you alive in the point.</li>
                <li><strong>When returning:</strong> Don't worry if you can't always control the quality of your return‚Äîfocus on getting your follow-up shot back in play. Consistency at this level wins matches.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="level-section">
            <div class="level-title">üèÜ Levels 4.5 and Above: Controlled Aggression</div>
            <p><strong>Primary Goal: Hit the most aggressive second shot possible while minimizing errors.</strong></p>
            <p>Advanced players must balance risk and reward:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>When serving:</strong> You might need a more aggressive second serve to avoid getting attacked, accepting some double faults. But once you get your serve in, use your second shot to establish an advantage in the point. Missing a few second shots is acceptable‚Äîbut it should be rare.</li>
                <li><strong>When returning:</strong> Use your second shot to either neutralize your opponent's advantage or seize control yourself. Sometimes the most "aggressive" shot is actually a defensive lob when your opponent has hit an excellent serve or approach shot.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            Remember: "Aggressive" doesn't always mean "powerful." The smartest second shot might be a perfectly placed defensive lob, a well-angled slice, or a deep crosscourt ball that puts your opponent in trouble.

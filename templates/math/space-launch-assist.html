        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>Space launch has traditionally relied on vertical rocket systems that must overcome Earth's gravity while carrying their entire propulsion system and fuel load from ground level. This paper presents analysis of a horizontal electromagnetic rail launch system for space launch assist, examining its mechanical advantage for winged launch vehicles. Unlike traditional rocket designs where minimizing mass is paramount, this concept benefits from concentrating significant mass behind a minimal forward-facing profile, fundamentally changing the optimization approach. The mechanical advantage increases non-linearly with launch velocity, suggesting rail-assisted launch could enable more efficient space access. The SpaceX Starship and Super Heavy configuration was used as a reference case to quantify these benefits.</p>

        <h2>1.0 Introduction & Purpose</h2>
        <p>The challenge of achieving orbital altitude and velocity has traditionally been addressed through vertical launch systems that must overcome both Earth's gravity and atmospheric drag while carrying their entire propulsion system and fuel load from ground level. This paper presents an analysis of an alternative approach: using a horizontal electromagnetic rail launch system to impart initial velocity to a winged rocket design.</p>
        <p>The core principle is to use an external system (the railgun) to achieve the initial, most challenging phase of velocity gain, thereby reducing the fuel mass the rocket itself needs to carry. This changes the design optimization problem from minimizing total mass to maximizing the mechanical advantage of the rail system.</p>
        
        <p>The system envisioned involves a vehicle accelerated horizontally to speeds greater than Mach 4, where the mechanical advantage becomes significant, launching it at an optimal angle for a continued flight path into orbit. </p>
        
        <h2>2.0 Mechanical Advantage Analysis (Summary)</h2>
        <p>The analysis focuses on quantifying the reduction in effective propellant mass needed by the rocket to achieve the required velocity, factoring in both momentum change and gravitational potential energy savings. The benefits multiply dramatically as the launch assist velocity increases.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The analysis confirms that the mechanical advantage of a horizontal railgun launch system increases non-linearly with the initial launch velocity. For the Super Heavy Booster reference vehicle, achieving Mach 5 (approx. 1.7 km/s) via rail launch could result in a dramatic reduction in required propellant mass, translating directly to massive potential increases in payload capacity or significant reduction in the size/cost of the booster stage.</p>
        <p>This approach merits further investigation into engineering design challenges, particularly rail efficiency, heating, and structural stress on the vehicle. </p>

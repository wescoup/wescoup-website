    <h1>Prime Number Generation: A Constructive Approach</h1>
    <p>Based on the paper: "A Method for Generating Prime Numbers (A Constructive Approach)".</p>
</header>

<section class="content-section">
    <h2>The Core Concept</h2>
    <p>This method approaches prime generation not by testing divisibility (like the Sieve of Eratosthenes), but by calculating the set of all composite numbers up to a limit, and defining primes as the remaining complement.</p>
    
    <h2>Performance and Implementation</h2>
    <p>The core mathematical concept is refined through four iterative levels of optimization, with the final level capable of calculating all primes up to 20 million in seconds within a standard web browser using JavaScript implementation. </p>
